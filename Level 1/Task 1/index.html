            <p class="sectiontag">India ranks third in global data breaches in 2021: Report</p>
            <p class="section-subtag">We are living in a world where breach of digital data is one the biggest fears
                among
                people and companies. So, how safe is your personal data? Not much, if you are in India. As per a
                report,
                the country ranked third in the world in terms of number of data breaches, with a total of 86.63 million
                Indian users breached till November 2021.

                The report from cybersecurity company Surfshark used its own breach detection mechanism. India showed a
                351.6 per cent increase in affected accounts compared to last year. In 2020, around 19.18 million Indian
                users' data was breached.

                "In general, this year was slightly worse than the last in terms of data breach cases," it said.

                Apart from India, the country with the maximum data breaches this year was the United States, followed
                by
                Iran. Russia and France are the other countries in the top five as they accounted for more than half of
                all
                leaks of 2021, the report stated. Some of the biggest data breaches this year included COMB, Clubhouse,
                Facebook and Raychat.

                The Middle East particularly stood out among the countries that grew the most year-on-year breach-wise
                as
                Iran, Sudan, UAE and Iraq all showed extreme spikes, the report further added.</p>

            <p class="section-subtag">A backdoor in a computer system, a cryptosystem or an algorithm, is any secret
                method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls. They may exist for many reasons,
                including by original design or poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to
                allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for
                their existence, they create a vulnerability. Backdoors can be very hard to detect, and backdoors are
                usually discovered by someone who has access to application source code or intimate knowledge of the
                operating system of the computer.</p>

            <p class="section-subtag">Computer security, cybersecurity (cyber security), or information technology
                security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure,
                theft of, or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or
                misdirection of the services they provide. </p>
            <p class="section-subtag">
                The field has become of significance due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet,[3]
                and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of "smart" devices,
                including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things
                (IoT). Cybersecurity is also one of the significant challenges in the contemporary world, due to the
                complexity of information systems, both in terms of political usage and technology. Its primary goal is
                to ensure the system's dependability, integrity, and data privacy.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag">Hacker</p>
            <p class="section-subtag">A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical
                knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means.
                Though the term hacker has become associated in popular culture with a security hacker – someone who
                utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data
                which would otherwise be inaccessible to them – hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in
                legal situations. For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques in order to
                collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using anonymity tools (such
                as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask their identities online, posing as criminals themselves.[1][2]
                Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work. On the
                other hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement and security
                agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by state actors as a weapon of both legal and
                illegal warfare.</p>

            <p class="section-subtag">The difference between surface web, deep web, and dark net. The easiest way to
                remember these three types of internet webs is to remember the iceberg analogy by Data Scientist, Denis
                Shestakov. The WWW is like an iceberg, in which the smallest part of the entire network we visit
                regularly is on the top, but the biggest part is unseen.</p>
            <p class="section-subtag">Surface, dark, and deep web are connected to each other, forming a base for online
                operations. While operating on the surface is mostly secure, activities on deeper levels can be
                suspicious. In the event of the dark net, major operations are anonymous and usually used for shady
                purposes. For security reasons, it is better to avoid it, if it is not related to your specialization.

                whose contents are not indexed by standard web search-engines. This is in contrast to the "surface web",
                which is accessible to anyone using the Internet. Computer-scientist Michael K. Bergman is credited
                with coining the term in 2001 as a search-indexing term.</p>
            <p class="section-subtag">The content of the deep web is hidden behind login forms, and includes uses
                such as web mail, online banking, restricted access social-media pages and profiles, some web forums and
                code language that require registration for viewing content, and paywalled services such as video on
                demand and some online magazines and newspapers.</p>
            <p class="section-subtag">The content of the deep web can be located and accessed by a direct URL or IP

                access.Through the dark web, private computer networks can communicate and conduct business anonymously
                without divulging identifying information, such as a user's location. The dark web forms a small part of
                the deep web, the part of the Web not indexed by web search engines, although sometimes the term deep
                web is mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web.</p>
            <p class="section-subtag">The darknets which constitute the dark web include small, friend-to-friend
                peer-to-peer networks, as well as large, popular networks such as Tor, Freenet, I2P, and Riffle operated
                by public organizations and individuals. Users of the dark web refer to the regular web as Clearnet due
                to its unencrypted nature. The Tor dark web or onionland uses the traffic anonymization technique of
                onion routing under the network's top-level domain suffix .onion.</p>

            Red rooms are rumoured online spaces within the dark web, the shadowy underbelly of the internet, used to
            hide illegal activity online.

            </p>

            <p class="section-subtag"> According to online reports, they're murky spots where sickos can pay to watch
                live streamed videos, of rape, torture, murder, and worse.
            </p>

            <p class="section-subtag">

                Users are said to pay thousands, or even tens of thousands, for access to the dark clips.

                Urban legends surrounds red rooms have circulated for years, but so far no evidence has emerged that
                they exist.</p>

            <p class="section-subtag">Their name is thought to have originated from the 1983 horror film Videodrome,
                where torture is shown live on TV in a red-painted room.

            </p>

            <p class="section-subtag"> Alternatively, it's been suggested the phrase arose from "Red Rum", which spells
                "murder" backwards.</p>

            <li>Quantum computers allow particles to exist in two states simultaneously this structural instability
